# LIBS directory
In this directory, you are required to place all the external libraries your project depends on. 
Although, in principle, you can use git submodules (and place them under this directory), 
for the sake of easily compiling your application, placing the source code of the 
open source libraries is also fine. However, this approach is not applicable to
large dependencies, such as QT.
